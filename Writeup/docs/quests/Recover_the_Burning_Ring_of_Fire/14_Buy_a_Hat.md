## Elf Introduction

??? "Wombley Cube"
    Hey there! I'm Wombley Cube. It's so nice to see a friendly face.<br>
    What's an elf doing all the way down here with all these sporcs, you ask?<br>
    I'm selling snazzy, fancy-pants hats! You can buy them with Kringlecoin.<br>
    The reason I set up shop here is to gather intel on that shady Luigi.<br>
    I'm a member of the STINC: Santa's Team of Intelligent Naughty Catchers.<br>
    He and his gang are up to no good, I'm sure of it. We've got a real Code Brown here.<br>
    Purchase a hat so we look inconspicuous, and I'll clue you in on what we think they're scheming.<br>
    Of course, have a look at my inventory!<br>
    Oh, and if you haven't noticed, I've slipped hints for defeating these Sporcs around the tunnels!<br>
    Keep your eyes open, and you'll find all five of them. Wait, maybe it's six?

## Completion

    Nice hat! I think Ed Skoudis would say the same. It looks great on you.<br>
    So, here's what we've uncovered so far. Keep this confidential, ok?<br>
    Earlier, I overheard that disgruntled customer in the office saying he wanted in on the "rug pull".<br>
    If our suspicions are correct, that's why the sporcs want an invite to the presale so badly.<br>
    Once the "Bored Sporc Rowboat Society" NFTs officially go on sale, the sporcs will upsell them.<br>
    After most of the NFTs are purchased by unwitting victims, the Sporcs are going to take the money and abandon the project.<br>
    Mission #1 is to find a way to get on that presale list to confirm our suspicions and thwart their dastardly scheme!<br>
    We also think there's a Ring hidden there, so drop Mission #2 on them and rescue that ring!<br>
    Thank you for your business, dear customer!
