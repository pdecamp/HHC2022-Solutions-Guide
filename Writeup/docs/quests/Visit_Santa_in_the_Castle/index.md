# Visit Santa in the Castle

This objective unlocks after you have collected the 5 rings.  To complete it just go back to the North Pole and enter the Castle.

!!! quote "Santa"
    Congratulations! You have foiled Grinchum's foul plan and recovered the Golden Rings!<br>
	And by the magic of the rings, Grinchum has been restored back to his true, merry self: Smilegol!<br>
	You see, all Flobbits are drawn to the Rings, but somehow, Smilegol was able to snatch them from my castle.<br>
	To anyone but me, their allure becomes irresistable the more Rings someone possesses. <br>
	That allure eventually tarnishes the holder's Holiday Spirit, which is about giving, not possesing.<br>
	That's exactly what happened to Smilegol; that selfishness morphed him into Grinchum.<br>
	But thanks to you, Grinchum is no more, and the holiday season is saved!<br>
    Ho ho ho, happy holidays!
